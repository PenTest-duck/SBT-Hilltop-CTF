# Blindsighted - Writeup

This steganography challenge requires the solver to adjust brightness and contrast levels and convert Braille to decimal numbers and finally to ASCII.

Finding the Braille within the image shouldn't be difficult, as its transparency isn't very low and the challenge prompt gave a very critical clue that (a) the flag is visible, and (b) the flag is somewhere within the night background of the image.
