# Sneaky Transmission

Our server at HQ has been receiving a flood of ICMP packets from our undercover agent.
Find out what he is sending us.

Hint 1: The TTLs on those ICMP echo requests seem strange...

Hint 2: I've heard that he's sending us a picture of the flag.

Hint 3: What if the TTL was a byte of the .png file?
